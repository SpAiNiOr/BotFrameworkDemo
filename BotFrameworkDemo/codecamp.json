Learning, working, decision making and leading are shaped due to their presence.\r\nI want to share with the public initiatives that I’ve implemented within a team of millennial testers, failed and successful initiatives, mindset changes within the team and the organization (including myself) and lessons learned.\r\n\r\n3. Session Take Away\r\nMy audience can learn from this session:\r\n- How to promote sharing and learning in a team or organization;\r\n- How to keep a team of millennial testers motivated;\r\n- What I learned from my team of millennial testers;\r\n4.

          "description": "Software testing is knowledge work, and the most important elements we operate every day is information. This element of daily work can take many shapes, including both evident format, such as specifications, implementation details, test details, test results, as well as tacit information and knowledge that is in abundance in today’s cross functional software development teams.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the most influential person I know of in the software testing industry, Jerry Weinberg, said in one of his books that testers have a primary mission of delivering information to those who are to make decisions about the tested piece of work. Many times, the decision-making persons are not mentally close to neither how software is developed not how it is tested. These stakeholders can exercise power and influence in the organization, and usually have a more business-oriented mindset. These are the kind of persons testers need to provide information to, as Jerry said.\r\n\r\nThe difference between testers and business stakeholders in terms of mindset, culture and other aspects of how software is approached potentially create a communication gap between these two sides who should work together.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Linda Rising once said that in order to influence one, communication is best to use the language of the one needing influencing.\r\n\r\nOperating with information, mastering testing sometimes equals mastering communication, besides the excelling in the testing craft. At times, testers even if good communicators, need to co-exist in organizational environments that have the communication channels & mechanisms shaped by others, such as project managers or other business related roles, and testers need to be able to navigate and thrive in such communication landscapes.\r\n\r\nI will show how a communication model can serve both building the message appropriate for business and PM to understand, as well as for explaining better the role and function of the testing activity in the context of the project and share my experience on how testers can advocate for their role or structure communication with stakeholders by using project management body of knowledge elements.\r\n",

Get ready and embark with us on a journey through product wormholes, right up to the encounter points with your product’s archenemies: inutility, cancellation, litigation, bankruptcy. We'll take a look on how apparently disconnected events in your product lifecycle tie in together and influence the end result. The workshop explores how past decisions, actions and events influence the product’s present value. Join us on holodeck to learn about some major factors that influence the product fabric, and identify the counter maneuvers that help you keep the product on course. \r\n\r\nRegistrations open!\r\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/RdJbrbhfwDRxYtd52",

How does this affect you and what are the costs involved? Multiply this by the number of repositories, each playing a definite role in a large-scale project, and you will want to know how to minimize the impact.\r\n\r\nThe branching model needs to be simple - so that everyone involved can grasp it quickly; flexible - so it can serve the needs of very different roles within the project lifecycle; and adaptable - when you have a particular unforeseen need, it should not be a barrier.\r\n\r\nSee what others are already using, ask a few questions that might drive an adaptation of your choice, and then choose wisely. Then let your team spend their time on coding rather than painfully switching strategies.",
