This talk is the distillation of my learnings, which can be summed up in three main points: Show floor presence, Player experience and Follow up. My aim is to demystify the process of showing games at events for new developers, and teach them how to sidestep the many common pitfalls.\r\n\r\nI will go in-depth with a variety of things I have learned including visual identity, how to grab the player's attention, building an effective booth, how to talk about your game, the importance of spectators, play session times, showcasing as a source of motivation, the importance of networking and mixer parties, optimizing your game so it runs on its own, wired vs wireless controllers, how to handle sound, various ways of applying for conventions, documenting the experience, showcasing as a form of play testing, why flyers are horrible and why people should stop printing them, giveaways and what both you and the player takes away from the whole experience.\r\n\r\nI will also talk about common misconceptions such as \"I can't possibly get accepted into big gaming events because I'm a small developer,\" \"recovering exhibition costs by selling copies after events\" and \"you need a lot of money to exhibit at an event\".\r\n\r\nFinally, this talk will highlight the most important mistake new developers make when showing their games: Focusing on selling copies rather than networking. Developers showing at events should focus on networking, and realize that just being present at an event can lead to potential collaborations in the future, even without having a booth on the show floor.",

To be part of the game and even more, to stay and lead the game, a company at one point needs to perform in a different way. Processes, domain expertise, tools are elements that influence the outcome. Once excellence is reached, identification of the elements that made it possible is easy but the other way around is not.\r\nTo better frame the problem: among processes, domain expertise or tools which and how these needs to be changed to reach excellence?\r\nI will talk about a real product that competes with big names and a transformation towards excellence.\r\n",

This is one of the challenges that you may have faced when attempting to automate your tests with Selenium. Wouldn’t it be useful to capture our UI changes constantly together with your Selenium tests? Therefore in this talk I’d like to tell you about an open-source library I developed together with my colleagues at Altom. This library is based on Image Comparison and it helps you automate the process of comparing different sections or elements of web pages. So you can check that your web app LOOKS the way you want it to look. Our focus will be on what this library is, how we can integrate it with our existing Selenium tests, and how a report will look like.",
