They are here!\r\nEven thought millennials are a big presence in almost all companies, especially in software development, only few subjects or concrete actions converge around this topic. Learning, working, decision making and leading are shaped due to their presence.\r\nI want to share with the public initiatives that I’ve implemented within a team of millennial testers, failed and successful initiatives, mindset changes within the team and the organization (including myself) and lessons learned.\r\n\r\n3. Session Take Away\r\nMy audience can learn from this session:\r\n- How to promote sharing and learning in a team or organization;\r\n- How to keep a team of millennial testers motivated;\r\n- What I learned from my team of millennial testers;\r\n4. Intended Audience\r\nEven the “experiments” are mainly done with a testing team, the subject is quite general and applicable to any team profile (developers, analysts) so everybody can benefit from it at the end.\r\n5. Previous Speaking Engagements\r\nI presented the same topic at Tabara de Testare Bucuresti.\r\n",

          "description": "Software testing is knowledge work, and the most important elements we operate every day is information. This element of daily work can take many shapes, including both evident format, such as specifications, implementation details, test details, test results, as well as tacit information and knowledge that is in abundance in today’s cross functional software development teams.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the most influential person I know of in the software testing industry, Jerry Weinberg, said in one of his books that testers have a primary mission of delivering information to those who are to make decisions about the tested piece of work. Many times, the decision-making persons are not mentally close to neither how software is developed not how it is tested. These stakeholders can exercise power and influence in the organization, and usually have a more business-oriented mindset. These are the kind of persons testers need to provide information to, as Jerry said.\r\n\r\nThe difference between testers and business stakeholders in terms of mindset, culture and other aspects of how software is approached potentially create a communication gap between these two sides who should work together.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Linda Rising once said that in order to influence one, communication is best to use the language of the one needing influencing.\r\n\r\nOperating with information, mastering testing sometimes equals mastering communication, besides the excelling in the testing craft. At times, testers even if good communicators, need to co-exist in organizational environments that have the communication channels & mechanisms shaped by others, such as project managers or other business related roles, and testers need to be able to navigate and thrive in such communication landscapes.\r\n\r\nI will show how a communication model can serve both building the message appropriate for business and PM to understand, as well as for explaining better the role and function of the testing activity in the context of the project and share my experience on how testers can advocate for their role or structure communication with stakeholders by using project management body of knowledge elements.\r\n",

Session Summary\r\nTest automation! Everybody understands it’s importance but nobody is willing to invest!\r\nI had a really hard time when I had to convince everybody from my organization that we have to start doing test automation, that we need resources for it and that we have to involve everybody in the process and not only testers.\r\nBut I didn’t give up and I gathered and gathered arguments and metrics till I convinced them.\r\nI would like to share this experience with CodeComp community and help them with some ideas for how to convince their peers and stakeholders to implement test automation.\r\n\r\n3. Session Take Away\r\nMy audience can learn from this session:\r\n- arguments for promoting test automation at all levels( developers, testers, project managers, product owners, IT managers).\r\n- Metrics or statistics to use in the test automation lifecycle (in order to monitor the efficiency of test automation in your organization and in order to monitor if test automation is really happening in your organization).\r\n4.
